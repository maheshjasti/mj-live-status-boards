##Live status boards library


Live status board(LSB) is a component that displays your live updates in a nice way. Especially if you are trying to show live scores/numbers that can dynamically increase or decrease, then LSB can understand what part of the digits to scroll and update the display. This works good for short messages which frequently changes and where you need to scroll up this new message in a nice way.
